"""

Determine the popularity of certain words in the text.

You are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine.

- The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
- The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
- If the word wasn't found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.

Input: The text and the search words array
Output: The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the number of times when those words are occurring in a given text.

>>> popular_words('When I was One I had just begun When I was Two I was nearly new', ['i', 'was', 'three', 'near'])
{'i': 4, 'was': 3, 'three': 0, 'near': 0}
