"""

Given a string and two markers (the initial and final), find a substring enclosed between these two markers. 

Important conditions:
- The initial and final markers are always different.
- If there is no initial marker, then the first character should be considered the beginning of a string.
- If there is no final marker, then the last character should be considered the ending of a string.
- If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.
- If the final marker comes before the initial marker, then return an empty string.

Input: Three arguments. All strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
Output: A string.

Precondition: can't be more than one final marker and can't be more than one initial. Marker can't be an empty string
