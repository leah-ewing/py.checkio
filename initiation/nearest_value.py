"""

Find the nearest value to the given one.

You are given a list of values as set form and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.

- If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;
- The set of numbers is always non-empty, i.e. the size is >= 1;
- The given value can be in this set, which means that it's the answer;
- The set can contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;
- The set isn't sorted and consists of unique numbers.

Input: Two arguments. A list of values in the set form. The sought value is an int.
Output: Int.
